For now, here's a brief description of the gameplay.

## How to catch fish

1. The game starts in an idle state. Hold the phone in your right hand, with the screen pointing left.

2. Pull the phone back as if preparing to throw it until a chime is heard, indicating that a cast is primed.

3. "Cast" by performing a forward swinging motion with your phone.
   * If a sufficient acceleration was registered, the line will be cast.
   * If sufficient acceleration was *not* registered, a second chime will be heard, indicating a return to the idle state.

4. The line is cast a certain distance and time, proportional to the acceleration of the swing. Meanwhile the reel is producing a clicking sound.

5. A "splash" sound effect is played when the hook lands in the water.

6. From now on, you can start reeling in the line at any time by pressing the "REEL IN" button. To catch a fish however, you need to wait.

7. After a random amount of time (10-30s) a fish will approach. You may hear it splashing, and feel small vibrations as it nibbles on the bait. But to get it on the hook, you need to wait until it bites, which is indicated by a constant vibration. If you wait to long however, the fish will get away with the bait. If you are successful, you proceed to the next step. Otherwise, you go back to the previous step.

8. Reel in the fish by holding the "REEL IN" button. If you leave the line slack (i.e. not holding the button) for too long, the fish will get away.

9. If you reel in the line entirely (0m) without the fish escaping, the fish will be caught.
